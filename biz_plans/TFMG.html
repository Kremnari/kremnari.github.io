            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>The Factory Must Grow is a mobile incremental game themed around an every growing factory.  The player is tasked with creating production lines,
                managing base resource production, advancing technologies, and pushing back enemies to recover land.<br />
                While many incremental games focus on ever increasing costs, and a limited number of resource counters,
                The Factory Must Grow will flip those, instead focusing on a large number of resources (items), and expansion increasing costs only in a few places.
                During this pandemic, many people have been at home yielding to entertainment and distractions being in higher demand.  
                Logistics management games like Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program have seen 
                But this won't be the case for long, and an expanded audience enjoying this kinds of expansive logistics games will soon find themselves 
                removed from their computer and back outside with their phones.
                Why not have a similar gaming experience ready for them when they migrate back into the mobile social world?
