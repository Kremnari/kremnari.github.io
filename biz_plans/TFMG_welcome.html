  <h4>Welcome fellow visionary!</h4>
  
  <p>You are likely here because you have felt the joys of watching a fledgling startup finally lift off under its own power.<br>
    And though you have (often?) felt the sting of failure, it has not deterred you from continuing to invest with wonder of what's to come.<br><br>
    You continue to march forth looking for the next opportunity to impact the world, and be a positive influence.<br>
    So do I.</p>

<p>To bootstrap my own efforts, I have been developing a game tentatively titled "The Factory Must Grow,"<br>
  A production line management game intended for idle/casual play on mobile.<br>
  I have my current version online at <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/TheFactoryMustGrow/">here</a></p>
  

<p>This game is inspired by the PC game Factorio; a horribly addictive game in its own right.<br>
This video gives a decent overview of that game, and it's qualities of addictiveness: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5r26fXTbA8">YouTube</a>
Other similar games have been developed that show a continued interest by consumers, but those on mobile don't provide a good 'feel' to them.
</p>

<p>While the game is in it's early stages, a limited public release has shown there is great interest in this game's format.<br>
Check it out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/q5yf3x/the_factory_must_grow_prototype_release/">on reddit</a>
I want to bring this to a professional and long-term enjoyable experience, so focus is key.
</p>

<p>To that end, I am seeking investors that can see not just the potential in this product, but in me, to bring more solutions to bear on the world.<br>
I have created a <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/tfmg_canvas.pdf">LeanCanvas</a> and a rough <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/TFMG.html">business plan</a> to highlight the potentials of this game.<br>
But more than that, it's always good to keep an eye on the bigger picture, my <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/projects.html">projects page</a><br>
has a number of projects to keep me producing new IPs that push technology in the near future.</p>

<p>While not specifically related to my current development goals, this site <a href="https://myorangeconnection.com/alpha/main.php">My Orange Connection</a> is an
  example of my skills approximately 6 years ago.<br>This site (client and server) was put together solely by me over a three month period, full-time (often with a newborn cuddled in my lap).<br>

<p>After you've reviewed these, I am certainly available to answer additional questions that you come up with.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration, <br>
