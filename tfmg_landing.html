            Thank you for your interest in testing my game.<br>
            It is inspired by Factorio (and many others) with an de-emphasis on layout management<br>
            I hope it will bring you entertainment throughout the upcoming days and weeks (and soon years!)<br>
            The alpha version is located <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/TheFactoryMustGrow/">here</a><br>
            <h5>Current Status</h5>
            The current alpha has some basic items and a tutorial to explain the current mechanics.
            <h5>Things to evaluate and enjoy</h5>
            How well can you get through the tutorial?<br>
            Do you have an understanding of the mechanics and how they fit together?<br>

            <h5>Monetization</h5>
            Don't want to get addicted to a new game, and then be money-gouged to progress as it matures?<br>
            Don't worry, I plan to release content packs for a few bucks here and there.

            <h5>Secret Sauce</h5>
            This game is built with several personnally developed libraries that are designed to dynamically generate the User Experience.<br>
            These library are still being fleshed out, but their applications extend far beyond this single game, including VR/XR and deep learning.
