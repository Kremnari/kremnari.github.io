## Json Schema Data Source - Data dump
This is a listing of resources and their place in my vision of this tool

### Goals
- To develop a single tool for creating a schema and it's data in a Json format. (target-jDS2
- This tool will be adaptive from the start, and rebuild it's forms as the schema changes.
- It should provide immediate validation when schema or data change.
- Allow the creation of different 'views', sections of the resultant JSON that can be split into multiple files


### Sources dump

1. [jsonform schema](https://github.com/jsonform/jsonform/issues/298) - Creating a schema for the gui-sided forms.
  This would allow some control into how the target-jDS2
2. [jsonform.io](https://jsonforms.io/docs/what-is-jsonforms) - A similar example to what I want, but this requires the ui-schema to be predeveloped.
  I want to create a dynamic ui-schema and data-schema at runtime.
3. Running #2 off of #1, and providing typical save/edit features, is close to what I wish to accomplish
