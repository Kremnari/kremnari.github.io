  <h4>Welcome fellow visionary!</h4>
  
  <p>You are likely here because you have felt the joys of watching a fledgling startup finally lift off under its own power.<br>
    And though you have (often?) felt the sting of failure, it has not deterred you from continuing to invest with wonder of what's to come.<br>
    You continue to march forth looking for the next opportunity to impact the world, and be a positive influence.<br>
    So do I.</p>

<p>To bootstrap my own efforts, I have been developing a game tentatively titled "The Factory Must Grow,"<br>
  A production line management game intended for idle/casual play.<br>
  I have my current version online at <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/TheFactoryMustGrow/">here</a></p>
  

<p>This game is inspired by the PC game Factorio; a horribly addictive game in its own right.<br>
This video gives a decent overview of that game, and it's qualities of addictiveness: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5r26fXTbA8">YouTube</a>
</p>

<p>For my game, I have created a <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/tfmg_canvas.pdf">LeanCanvas</a> to highlight the unique value proposition of my game;<br>
while my <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/TFMG.html">business plan</a> gives a better idea of the potential market and revenue.<br>
  And as it's always good to keep an eye on the bigger picture, my <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/projects.html">projects page</a> has my current, general, roadmap.</p>

<p>While not specifically related to my current development goals, this site <a href="https://myorangeconnection.com/alpha/main.php">My Orange Connection</a> is an
  example of my skills approximately 3 years ago.<br>This site (client and server) was put together solely by me in a month full-time (often with a newborn cuddled in my lap).<br>

<p>After you've reviewed these, I am certainly available to answer additional questions that you come up with.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration, <br>
