Good day Aron, 

So the game I am developing is tentatively titled "The Factory Must Grow."
I have my current version up <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/TheFactoryMustGrow/">here</a>

This game is based on the PC game Factorio; a horribly addictive game.<br>
This video gives a decent overview of the game, and it's addictiveness: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5r26fXTbA8">YouTube</a>

I created a <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/tfmg_canvas.pdf">LeanCanvas</a> to highlight the specific goals and solutions of my game;<br>
while my <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/TFMG.html">business plan</a> gives a better idea of the potential market and revenue.


After you've reviewed these, I am certainly available to answer additional questions that you come up with.

Thank you for your consideration
Nick
