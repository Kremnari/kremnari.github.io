Good day Aron,<br>

<p>So the game I am developing is tentatively titled "The Factory Must Grow."<br>
  I have my current version up <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/TheFactoryMustGrow/">here</a></p>
  

<p>This game is based on the PC game Factorio; a horribly addictive game.<br>
This video gives a decent overview of the game, and it's addictiveness: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5r26fXTbA8">YouTube</a>
  </p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/tfmg_canvas.pdf">LeanCanvas</a> to highlight the specific goals and solutions of my game;<br>
while my <a href="https://digitalpsigen.tech/biz_plans/TFMG.html">business plan</a> gives a better idea of the potential market and revenue.</p>
<br>

<p>After you've reviewed these, I am certainly available to answer additional questions that you come up with.</p>
<br>
<p>Thank you for your consideration, <br>
Nick
